DispatchWorkItem: A dispatch work item has a cancel flag. If it is cancelled before running, the dispatch queue wonâ€™t execute it and will skip it. If it is cancelled during its execution, the cancel property return True. In that case, we can abort the execution

- CANCELLABLE

```class SearchViewController: UIViewController, UISearchBarDelegate {
    // We keep track of the pending work item as a property
    private var pendingRequestWorkItem: DispatchWorkItem?

    func searchBar(_ searchBar: UISearchBar, textDidChange searchText: String) {
        // Cancel the currently pending item
        pendingRequestWorkItem?.cancel()

        // Wrap our request in a work item
        let requestWorkItem = DispatchWorkItem { [weak self] in
            self?.resultsLoader.loadResults(forQuery: searchText)
        }

        // Save the new work item and execute it after 250 ms
        pendingRequestWorkItem = requestWorkItem
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + .milliseconds(250),
                                      execute: requestWorkItem)
    }
}
```
